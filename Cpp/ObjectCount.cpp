 /*
 Define a class item. Declare a static variable with a name of count and use this member to count the number objects created.

 This class should have public methods to display the count value.
 
 Write a C++ program to Count the number of objects using the Static member function
 
        Important points about Static :

        A static member is shared by all objects of the class, all static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created, if no other initialization is present.

        A static member function can only access static data member, other static member functions and any other functions from outside the class.

        By declaring a function member as static, we make it independent of any particular object of the class. A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist and the static functions are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator :: .

        We canâ€™t put it in the class definition but it can be initialized outside the class as done in the following example by re-declaring the static variable, using the scope resolution operator :: to identify which class it belongs to.
